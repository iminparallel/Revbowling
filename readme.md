This project is a continuation of
Corey Schafer's flaskblog tutorial (check out his youTube channel).

After finishing the tutorial series, which included authentication, and a blogging system I decided to add like and comment feature for the blog posts.

Live chat feature has also been implemented using javascript web sockets.

see requirements.txt for the list of dependencies
